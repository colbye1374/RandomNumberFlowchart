*this is how to write the code for a flowchart about a random number guessing game with mermaid in a markup language.
 1. The computer will generate a random number.
 2. The computer will prompt the user for an input of a number inbetween certain numbers like 1-100.
 3. the computer will check if the guess was correct.
 4. it will determine if the question is wrong it will inform you if you are higher or lower then the number.
 5. the final step is that the computer will keep taking inputs and informing you if you are higher or lower until you guess the correct answer and the program ends.
